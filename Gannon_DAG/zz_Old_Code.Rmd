## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{Simplified DAG}
 DAG_oxygen_under_ice_simplified <- dagify(
      
      #Identify Relatiobships 
      anox_duration ~ O2_at_Freeze + Ice_Duration + Rate_O2_Drawdown,
      Rate_O2_Drawdown ~ ER_under_ice + GPP_under_ice, 
      ER_under_ice ~ Freezing_Degree_Days + DOC_at_Freeze,
      DOC_at_Freeze ~ Terrestrial_DOC_Inputs + Summer_GPP, 
      Summer_GPP~ Terrestrial_DOC_Inputs + Lake + Year,
      Freezing_Degree_Days ~ Lake + Year, 
      Terrestrial_DOC_Inputs ~ Lake + Year, 
      O2_at_Freeze ~ Lake, 
      Ice_Duration ~ Lake + Year, 
      GPP_under_ice ~ Lake + Year, 
      
      # Specify exposure and outcome 
      exposure = "DOC_at_Freeze", 
      outcome = "anox_duration",
      
      # Label 
      labels = c(outcome = "Annoxic Duration",
                 exposure = "DOC at Lake Freeze "))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
