# EBIO 5460: Causal Inference in Ecology

Website for EBIO 5460: Causal Inference in Ecology for Spring 2025 taught by Laura Dee. 

We made this course page using the template developed by Francisco Rodriguez-Sanchez (https://github.com/Pakillo/quarto-course-website-template), with additional inspiration from Andrew Heiss (https://www.andrewheiss.com/) and based on the course and page of EBIO 5460 course, developed and taught by Laura Dee and Katherine Siegel at the University of Colorado-Boulder in Spring 2023.
