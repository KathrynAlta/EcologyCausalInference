## Resources of creating and analyzing Directed Acyclic Graphs

## Useful Videos

#### Conceptual

-   Discussion of how to identify associations, close backdoors, and isolate pathways in a DAG by A. Heiss: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qs_1B4ySWY>

-   Watch Hernan video: "3. Elements of DAGs"

#### Implementation

-   How to build and begin to analyze them it in ggdag by A. Heiss: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoAjyyToUTE>

-   Drawing DAGs with Daggit.net by A. Heiss: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3euqrnD9w7c

## Software for DAG construction and analysis

a\) [Daggitity](https://www.dagitty.net)

b\) [ggdag](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-ggdag.html) is a nice R package based on dagitty but in R tidyverse-compatible and with much better plotting functionality\
c) [shinydag](https://www.gerkelab.com/project/shinydag/) is another GUI aimed at visualizing DAGs and exporting them in different publication-ready formats\
d) [TETRAD](https://sites.google.com/view/tetradcausal)\
e) [DAG program](https://hsz.dife.de/dag/)\
f) [dagR](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2010/07000/dagR__A_Suite_of_R_Functions_for_Directed_Acyclic.26.aspx)
