    "text": "In general, on Mondays we will have brief lectures and demonstrations in R, while on Wednesdays, we will have student-led paper discussions and/or replication exercises of published papers. In the latter half of the course, we will shift to workshopping our own projects and discussing additional issues and considerations with applied causal inference. In this way, we will use a partially flipped classroom and strive to create a collaborative and inclusive classroom environment to discuss, ask questions, collaborate, and get feedback on your analyses.\nThe tentative schedule of content, subject to change based on student interests, is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nMonday\nWednesday\nGoals/Topics\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1 (1/16)\nNo class\nCourse intro\n• Intro to course and goals  • Understand students’ goals for the course  • Set norms and expectations\n\n\nWeek 2 (1/23)\nIntro to causal inference and counterfactual causality\nIntro to the main frameworks for counterfactual causal inference\n• Intro to concepts in causal inference and motivation for applying it to ecology and evolution  • Introduction to two main frameworks for counterfactual causality (potential outcomes and graphical causal modeling frameworks)\n\n\nWeek 3 (1/30)\nIntro to DAGs (Guest speaker: Dr. Zach Laubach)\nWorkshopping DAGs: come prepared to present and share/discuss your DAG\n• DAGs as a tool from the graphical causal modeling framework  • Students create and workshop DAGs for their own research/study systems\n\n\nWeek 4 (2/6)\nRandomized Controlled Experiments (or RCTs) and experimental design\nDissect experimental design with respect to assumptions required for causal inference\n• Application of potential outcomes framework to RCTs  • Review key assumptions of RCTs  • Critique experimental designs in ecology and identify solutions\n\n\nWeek 5 (2/13)\nObservational data and counterfactuals\nIntroduction to quasi-experimental methods\n• Articulate how and why observational data deviates from assumptions of RCTs  • Understand challenges of applying causal inference to observational data, including confounding and selection bias  • Get a sense of the landscape of tools for overcoming challenges\n\n\nWeek 6 (2/20)\nPre-regression matching\nPaper discussion and replication exercise\n• Learn pre-regression matching as a method  • Demo application in R  • See & critique how it is applied in the literature\n\n\nWeek 7 (2/27)\nDifference in Difference (DiD)\nPaper discussion\n• Learn DiD designs, including identification assumptions and interpretation  • Demo application in R  • Compare DiD to matching and experiments  • See & critique how it is applied in the literature\n\n\nWeek 8 (3/6)\nPanel methods\nPaper discussion and replication exercise\n• Learn within estimators (two-way fixed effects) including identification assumptions and interpretation  • Compare panel designs with conditioning on observables designs and with random effect/mixed effect models in R and understand the differences in assumptions  • Compare applications in literature and the assumptions required for the conclusions drawn\n\n\nWeek 10 (3/13)\nInstrumental Variables\nPaper discussion\n• Learn IV as a method  • Demo application in R  • See & critique how it is applied in the literature\n\n\nWeek 9 (3/20)\nRegression Discontinuity Designs (RDD)\nPaper discussion\n• Learn RDD as a method  • Demo application in R  • See & critique how it is applied in the literature\n\n\nWeek 11 (3/27)\nSpring break (no class)\nSpring break (no class)\n\n\n\nWeek 12 (4/3)\nProject work session (in groups)\nOne-on-one consultations on projects\n• Make progress on project and get feedback from class\n\n\nWeek 13 (4/10)\nProject work session\nProject work session\n• Make progress on project and get feedback on proposed research design and challenges so far\n\n\nWeek 14 (4/17)\nBrief presentation on project\nProject work and workshopping\n• Make progress on project and get feedback from class\n\n\nWeek 15 (4/24)\nProject work and workshopping\nSpecial topic: Generalizability (Guest speaker: Dr. Becks Spake)\n• Make progress on project and get feedback from class  • Introduction to challenges with generalizability\n\n\nWeek 16 (5/1)\nProject presentations\nProject presentations\n• Clearly communicate the application of causal inference methods to a research question in ecology OR present a topic we did not cover as a class",
