Here is some code to demonstrate that (you'll likely need to modify this)\n```{r}\n# ### Extract the matches from the MatchIt object\n# matched <- match.data(match)\n# \n# ### Open the full data (entire time series) \n# full_data <- read.csv(\"file_path/colo_dat_full.csv\")\n# \n# ### Filter full_data to just include the UIDs of the matched subset of the data\n# full_data <- full_data %>%\n#   filter(UID %in% matched$UID)\n```\n\n### Add time lag variables\nIn my analyses, I used time lag variables to account for recent fire history: if a site burned last year, it usually won't burn this year. So we'll make a variable that accounts for whether or not a site burned in the previous five years. \n\nSince we used a lag variable, we won't have complete data for the first few years of the time series, so we'll also filter the dataset to just include the years with complete data.\n```{r}\n# ### Add lag variable\n# full_data <- full_data %>%\n#   \n#   ### Group by the UID so you can make a site-specific lag variable\n#   group_by(UID) %>%\n#   \n#   ### Add the lag variable\n#   mutate(burn_prev_5_yr = dplyr::lag(burned, \n#                                      n = 5, \n#                                      default = NA,\n#                                      order_by = year)) %>%\n#   ungroup()\n# \n# ### Drop first years of time series\n# full_data <- full_data %>%\n#   filter(year > 1988)\n```\n\n### Check for correlated variables\nSome of the continuous variables are highly correlated, so we don't want to include them in the regression model.\n```{r}\n### Assess level of correlation\n\n### if you want to use it, here's a function that returns a table with the correlation coefficient and p-value between each pair of variables:\n# cor.prob <- function (X, dfr = nrow(X) - 2) {\n#   R <- cor(X, use=\"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n#   above <- row(R) < col(R)\n#   r2 <- R[above]^2\n#   Fstat <- r2 * dfr/(1 - r2)\n#   R[above] <- 1 - pf(Fstat, 1, dfr)\n#   R[row(R) == col(R)] <- NA\n#   R\n# }\n# flattenSquareMatrix <- function(m) {\n#   if( (class(m) != \"matrix\") | (nrow(m) != ncol(m))) stop(\"Must be a square matrix.\") \n#   if(!identical(rownames(m), colnames(m))) stop(\"Row and column names must be equal.\")\n#   ut <- upper.tri(m)\n#   data.frame(i = rownames(m)[row(m)[ut]],\n#              j = rownames(m)[col(m)[ut]],\n#              cor=t(m)[ut],\n#              p=m[ut])\n# }\n\n### Determine which variables to drop\n```\n\n### Model the effect of ownership/management on wildfire probability for a given site in a given year\nThis is the exciting part!
